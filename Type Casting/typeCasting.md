// ! What is typecasting?
// _ Allows you to change the data type of variable from one type to another.
// _ Crucial when you need to perform operation involving variables of different data types, ensuring that the data is handled correctly.
// For example - char -> int, int -> char, float -> int etc.

// Type casting are two type:
// ! 1. Implicit Type Casting
// Aka, Automatic Type conversion,
// Compiler automatically converts one data type to another during an operation.
// This happens when you perform operation involving variables different data types, and the compiler promotes one type to large type to maintain precision.

// ! 2. Explicit Type Casting
// Aka, manual type conversion.
// Allows you to explicitly specify the desired data type during an assignment or operation.
// You use the casting operator, which is represented by parentheses containing the target data type
