/**
 * Description:
 * You are given N number of books. Every ith book has Ai number of pages. You have to allocate contiguous books to M number of students. There can be many way or permutations to do so. In each permutation, one of the M students will be allocated the maximum number of pages. out of all these permutations , the task is to find that particular permutation in which the maximum number of pages allocated to a student is the minimum of those in all the other permutation and print this minimum value.
 * Each book will be allocated to exactly  one students. Each student has to be allocated at least one book.
 * Note: Return -1 if a valid assignment is not possible, and allotment should be in contiguous order(see the explanation for better understanding)
